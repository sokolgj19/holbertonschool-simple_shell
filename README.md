## üîé About the Project  
The **simple_shell** project is a recreation of a basic UNIX shell.  
It executes commands read from standard input (interactive or non-interactive mode), manages processes, uses the environment, and implements some built-ins.  

The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of system calls, process creation, and program execution in Linux.

## üéØ Learning Objectives  
By completing this project, we learned and can explain:  

- Who designed and implemented the original UNIX operating system  
- Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell  
- Who invented the B programming language (direct predecessor to C)  
- Who is Ken Thompson  
- How a shell works internally  
- What a PID and a PPID are  
- How to manipulate the environment of the current process  
- The difference between a function and a system call  
- How to create processes with `fork()`  
- The three valid prototypes of `main` in C  
- How the shell uses the `PATH` to locate programs  
- How to execute another program with `execve()`  
- How to wait for processes with `wait()`  
- What EOF (‚Äúend-of-file‚Äù) means

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features  
Our shell supports:  

- Displaying a prompt and waiting for user input  
- Executing commands entered by the user  
- Handling command arguments  
- Using the environment `PATH` to locate executables  
- Forking only if the command exists  
- Handling errors and printing messages similar to `/bin/sh`  
- Handling the end of file (Ctrl+D) gracefully  

**Built-ins implemented:**  
- `exit` ‚Üí exit the shell  
- `env` ‚Üí print the environment variables
